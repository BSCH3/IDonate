        <p>  
            Team KVMC are a group of web developer's that have decided to join in order to create a Web 
            Application called "Brief History of Computing". At each major event along the time-line there will be more 
            detailed information about the particular event that moved the technology forward.
            M-Learning or Mobile Learning is the concept of a user accessing a topic they are interested in, and learning more about the given topic as a result of the user interaction with the content of the application. Depending on the type of application the content can be accessed from MP3 players, notebooks, mobile phones and tablets. M-Learning allows for the user to access the content from anywhere as long as they have a mobile device. There is also the opportunity for users to share their experience with other users of the same application, aiding in a greater understanding of the source material.
            Gamification is a concept that awards the user in a way that increases interactivity with an application and records their progress. It can take the form of completing a profile, answering a questionnaire, answering quiz type questions and posting the results for other users to view.</P><P> Awards are gained by the users in the form of new features being opened up within the application, higher profile status or a ranking place on a leaderboard. Gamification can be used as a powerful marketing tool, by the application administrators gathering and analysing the response of each userâ€™s interaction within the application.
            In terms of E-Learning our application will aid people who have an interest in computers and would like to learn about the history of computing. It will also aid students who are thinking of entering a third level computer course.
            The gamification aspect of our application will be quizz based, with short multiple choice questions on each section of the timeline. The users results will be displayed on a leaderboard, allowing them to compare themselves with other users.
            </p>
            <p>
            This software is free  of charge and available for anyone who is interested in learning and gaining a basic  knowledge of  the history of computing. This software is especially useful for students who are taking  or thinking of taking related course, to help them improve their skill-set and knowledge of computing. 
            At the end of the brief computer history the users will have short  quizzes to complete which will act as a learning aid for the user.
            In order to use this software there are no skills or prior-knowledge required as long as the user knows how to read, and has some basic understanding in working with computers.
            The users may want to use this software to learn and know more about the history of computing . They might also use this software because it is free of charge, easier to use and available on any kind of devices, such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and so on.
            The software is going to have admin/login, so the users need to create  their own account and login every time they wish to use the software.
