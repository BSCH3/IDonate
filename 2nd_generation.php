            Transistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers. 
            The transistor was invented in 1947 but did not see widespread use in computers until the late 1950s. 
            The transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, 
            more energy-efficient and more reliable than their first-generation predecessors. Though the transistor still generated a 
            great deal of heat that subjected the computer to damage, it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube. Second-generation 
            computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output.

            The first machine that this new technology uses a super computer. IBM supercomputer does is stretch and Sprery-Rand a
            computer named LARC. These machines are developed, nuclear laboratories, the handling of large amounts of data, and 
            a force of atoms of researchers needed. The car was very expensive and tends to be complex for the IT needs of 
            enterprises, thus limiting its popularity.
            There are only two LARC never installed and used: one at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Livermore, California 
            and one in the U.S. Navy research and development center in Washington DC replaced the second generation of computer 
            machine language assembler. Assembler is an abbreviation used in place of binary code.
            In the early 1960s, many emerging countries in the second generation of computer success in business, academia and 
            government. The computer of the second generation is fully automated with transistors. They also have components 
            that can be coupled to the computer at the moment, a printer, memory, hard disk, memory, operating system and 
            programs.
            An important example is the IBM 1401 computer that is generally accepted in the industry. In 1965 almost all large 
            companies have used a computer to the second generation of financial reporting to be developed.
            The program in the programming language and programming is stored; there is the possibility of your computer. 
            Flexibility is the performance at a reasonable price for professional improvement. With this approach, the computer 
            could print customer invoices and then design a product or calculate payroll.
            Some programming languages began to appear at that time. Programming Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) and 
            Formula Translator (FORTRAN) are widespread. This programming language, the complex machine replaced by the words, 
            sentences, and mathematical formulas are easier to understand people. 
            This allows a person to plan and manage the computer. Several new types of careers (programmer, analyst and expert 
            systems). Software industry has also begun to occur in this computer-and second-generation development. 
            Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to symbolic, or assembly, languages, 
            which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words. High-level programming languages were also being developed at this time, 
            such as early versions of COBOL and FORTRAN. 
            These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory, which moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology.</p>
