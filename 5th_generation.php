        <p>
            An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents 
            the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful 
            and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU). Most of the operations of a CPU are 
            performed by one or more ALUs, which load data from input registers. A register is a small amount of storage 
            available as part of a CPU. The control unit tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data and the ALU stores 
            the result in an output register. The control unit moves the data between these registers, the ALU and memory.
            This generation of computers represents a unification of four separate areas of research: 
            - knowledge-based expert systems 
            - very high-level programming languages 
            - decentralised computing 
            - very large-scale integration technology (VLSI).
            Computers of this generation make use of parallel processing and they are capable of performing multiple, 
            simultaneous instructions using more than one microprocessing chip. </p>
        <p>How an ALU works:<br>
            An ALU performs basic arithmetic and logic operations. Examples of arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, 
            multiplication, and division. Examples of logic operations are comparisons of values such as NOT, AND, and OR.
            All information in a computer is stored and manipulated in the form of binary numbers, i.e. 0 and 1. Transistor 
            switches are used to manipulate binary numbers, since there are only two possible states of a switch: open or closed.
            An open transistor, through which there is no current, represents a 0. A closed transistor, through which there is a 
            current, represents a 1. Operations can be accomplished by connecting multiple transistors. One transistor can be 
            used to control a second one, in effect turning the transistor switch on or off depending on the state of the second 
            transistor. This is referred to as a gate, because the arrangement can be used to allow or stop a current.
            The simplest type of operation is a NOT gate. This uses only a single transistor. It uses a single input and 
            produces a single output, which is always the opposite of the input. The figure below shows the logic of the NOT gate.
            Other gates consist of multiple transistors and use two inputs. The OR gate results in a 1 if either the first or the
            second input is a 1. The OR gate only results in a 0 if both inputs are 0. The figure below shows the logic of the OR
            gate.
            The AND gate results in a 1 only if both the first and second input are 1s. The figure below shows the logic of the 
            AND gate.
            The XOR gate results in a 0 if both the inputs are 0 or if both are 1. Otherwise, the result is a 1. The figure below
            shows the logic of the XOR gate.</p>
        <p>Fifth generation computing devices, based on artificial intelligence, are still in development, though there are some
            applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today. 
            The use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality. Quantum 
            computation and molecular and nano-technology will radically change the face of computers in years to come. 
            The goal of fifth-generation computing is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable 
            of learning and self-organisation.</p>
